# Ghost-Azure
## Why Ghost-Azure?
Ghost-Azure provides a production-ready template which can be hosted directly on Azure App Service.

This is my fork of https://github.com/RadoslavGatev/Ghost-Azure which runs in the background, an Azure Function ([Ghost-Release-Uploader](https://github.com/RadoslavGatev/Ghost-Release-Uploader)) that makes sure that its repository stays up-to-date with the latest releases of Ghost.

Forked this repository to avoid any upstream changes that might affect my installation.
