I’m travelling with my best friend whom I just\nmarried.","feature_image":"/content/images/2019/07/munich-leg-3.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2019-07-15 19:53:06","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2019-07-15 20:10:12","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2016-06-29 20:09:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5d2cdeb12070ec15043fff9e","uuid":"ac41149d-3071-47e5-9767-e9c8c630860d","title":"First stop, München, Deutscheland","slug":"first-stop-munchen","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2019/07/munich-leg-90.jpg\",\"cardWidth\":\"wide\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2019/07/IMG_2578.JPG\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2019/07/munich-leg-94.jpg\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2019/07/img_2577-1-1.jpg\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2019/07/img_2576.jpg\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2019/07/img_2387.jpg\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2019/07/munich-leg-58.jpg\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2019/07/img_2569.jpg\"}],[\"embed\",{\"url\":\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BHR89KHhiSBv_fAMCsgOqp8L-BjGsF18vO-xtI0/\",\"html\":\"<blockquote class=\\\"instagram-media\\\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BHR89KHhiSBv_fAMCsgOqp8L-BjGsF18vO-xtI0/\\\" data-instgrm-version=\\\"12\\\" style=\\\" background:#FFF;

in Marienplatz is the most relaxing experience despite it being a shopper&#39;s dream. To our surprise we found it only got busy at 5pm when all the buskers came out and the walkways filled up with people. It was a beautiful mix of modern lifestyle within amazing heritage architecture. Also, Maccas here is green and yellow 🤔 and I only saw like 2-3 fat people...

Though I’m not quite sure why. It may have something\nto do with less taxes or fees when flying in and out of the Eurozone from\nMunich.\n\nWith that said, I absolutely love Munich. There’s something about it that has a\ncertain charm to it. I think a large part of that could be attributed to its\nvast and eclectic history. Nothing a couple of world wars can’t do to add to\nyour nation’s history.\n\nWe flew out of Melbourne W-DAY +1 at 1400 hours and landed at Munich W-DAY +2 at\n0700 hours local time so it worked out well and calibrated to the timezone with\nno jet laggage.\n\nClaudia was quite pleased with Thai Airways.\n\nFirst thing was first, hire a car. Found the car rental area in the airport\nterminal easy enough thanks to parallel English translations of almost every\nsign; perfect for the noob traveller like us.\n\nPicked up late model Audi TT which was super nice to drive. It had a great\ngearbox and a beautiful flat-bottomed steering wheel generally found in Audi’s\nRS marquee. Steering feel was effectively nil but was perfect for weaving around\nthe narrow side streets of Old Town.\n\nI felt completely overwhelmed and intimidated by the driving skill and culture\nof the Germans – particularly the Bavarians. This was BMW home turf. Lest we\nforget that they drive on the ‘right’ side of the road.\n\nSpeaking of which, we made our way to BMW Welt (BMW World) just north of Old\nTown. As I entered, I couldn’t help but reminisce of yesteryear at the Melbourne\nExhibition Centre back when we used to host the International Motor Shows;\nsurrounded by all things car. Except this was all things BMW.\n\nWe couldn’t have wandered around for more than 5 minutes before I saw the new\nBMW M2 and had a little perve.\n\nI got busted by one of the ‘curators’ and quickly picked up his bogan accent.\nSurprisingly, we talked for a bit, but nothing about cars – more about his move\nto Germany from Australia. Being tourists, he suggested we visit\nAugustiner-Keller, a 5000-seat beer garden not far from München Hauptbahnhof\n(Munich Railway Station).\n\nThe place had full on fresh vibes.

It’s not to say that it wasn’t good – it\nwas.

in Marienplatz is the most relaxing experience despite it being a shopper&#39;s dream. To our surprise we found it only got busy at 5pm when all the buskers came out and the walkways filled up with people. It was a beautiful mix of modern lifestyle within amazing heritage architecture. Also, Maccas here is green and yellow 🤔 and I only saw like 2-3 fat people...

But then we discovered BMW Welt and Tim wanted to rent an upper\nechelon car for an hour… For funsies. He’s sure to expand on this in his post.\nAll I can say about it is: gals, let your man unleash his “wild heart”. It shows\nhim you trust him and frees you to enjoy his adventurous spirit.

It honestly felt like we had entered a\nmovie, driving down these well maintained roads lining heritage construction.\n\nThere are many one-way streets and I’m pretty sure every single person owns a\nbike and rides it like it’s no one’s biznatch. Seriously though most aren’t even\nsecured to poles or gates when not in use! Just goes to show either everyone is\na saint or the custom is as common as a hipster in Brunswick on a dope summers\nday. And maybe this is why no one’s fat around here! I only saw 2-3 overweight\nhumans… Interesting innet?\n\nHmm what else…\n\nOh the shopping!

in Marienplatz is the most relaxing experience despite it being a shopper&#39;s dream. To our surprise we found it only got busy at 5pm when all the buskers came out and the walkways filled up with people. It was a beautiful mix of modern lifestyle within amazing heritage architecture. Also, Maccas here is green and yellow 🤔 and I only saw like 2-3 fat people...

in Marienplatz is the most relaxing experience despite it being a shopper&#39;s dream. To our surprise we found it only got busy at 5pm when all the buskers came out and the walkways filled up with people. It was a beautiful mix of modern lifestyle within amazing heritage architecture. Also, Maccas here is green and yellow 🤔 and I only saw like 2-3 fat people...

in Marienplatz is the most relaxing experience despite it being a shopper&#39;s dream. To our surprise we found it only got busy at 5pm when all the buskers came out and the walkways filled up with people. It was a beautiful mix of modern lifestyle within amazing heritage architecture. Also, Maccas here is green and yellow 🤔 and I only saw like 2-3 fat people...

in Marienplatz is the most relaxing experience despite it being a shopper&#39;s dream. To our surprise we found it only got busy at 5pm when all the buskers came out and the walkways filled up with people. It was a beautiful mix of modern lifestyle within amazing heritage architecture. Also, Maccas here is green and yellow 🤔 and I only saw like 2-3 fat people...

in Marienplatz is the most relaxing experience despite it being a shopper&#39;s dream. To our surprise we found it only got busy at 5pm when all the buskers came out and the walkways filled up with people. It was a beautiful mix of modern lifestyle within amazing heritage architecture. Also, Maccas here is green and yellow 🤔 and I only saw like 2-3 fat people...

in Marienplatz is the most relaxing experience despite it being a shopper&#39;s dream. To our surprise we found it only got busy at 5pm when all the buskers came out and the walkways filled up with people. It was a beautiful mix of modern lifestyle within amazing heritage architecture. Also, Maccas here is green and yellow 🤔 and I only saw like 2-3 fat people...

in Marienplatz is the most relaxing experience despite it being a shopper&#39;s dream. To our surprise we found it only got busy at 5pm when all the buskers came out and the walkways filled up with people. It was a beautiful mix of modern lifestyle within amazing heritage architecture. Also, Maccas here is green and yellow 🤔 and I only saw like 2-3 fat people...

in Marienplatz is the most relaxing experience despite it being a shopper&#39;s dream. To our surprise we found it only got busy at 5pm when all the buskers came out and the walkways filled up with people. It was a beautiful mix of modern lifestyle within amazing heritage architecture. Also, Maccas here is green and yellow 🤔 and I only saw like 2-3 fat people...

in Marienplatz is the most relaxing experience despite it being a shopper&#39;s dream. To our surprise we found it only got busy at 5pm when all the buskers came out and the walkways filled up with people. It was a beautiful mix of modern lifestyle within amazing heritage architecture. Also, Maccas here is green and yellow 🤔 and I only saw like 2-3 fat people...
